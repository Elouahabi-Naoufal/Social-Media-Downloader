            <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">All files are deleted automatically <strong>30 seconds after download completion</strong>. No permanent storage exists on our servers. Your download history is cleared when you close your browser session.</p>
            
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 dark:text-white mt-8 mb-4">6. Data Security</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">We implement industry-standard security measures including HTTPS encryption, secure file handling, and automatic cleanup processes to protect your data during the brief processing period.</p>
            
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 dark:text-white mt-8 mb-4">7. User Rights</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">You can use the service without registration or account creation. You may stop using it at any time. Since we don't store personal data, there's no data to delete or modify.</p>
            
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 dark:text-white mt-8 mb-4">8. Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">Our service interacts with social media platforms only to retrieve publicly available content. We are not affiliated with Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, or Reddit.</p>
            
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 dark:text-white mt-8 mb-4">9. Updates to This Policy</h2>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 dark:text-white mt-8 mb-4">10. International Data Transfers</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">Since our service operates globally and processes content from international platforms, temporary data processing may occur across different jurisdictions. However, given our 30-second deletion policy, no permanent cross-border data storage occurs.</p>
            
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 dark:text-white mt-8 mb-4">11. Children's Privacy Protection</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">We are committed to protecting children's privacy online. Our service does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided personal information, please contact us immediately. We will take steps to remove such information and terminate the child's access if necessary.</p>
            
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 dark:text-white mt-8 mb-4">12. GDPR Compliance (European Users)</h2>

            <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">In the unlikely event of a data breach, we will notify affected users and relevant authorities within 72 hours as required by law. However, our automatic deletion policy significantly reduces breach risks since no permanent user data is stored.</p>
            
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 dark:text-white mt-8 mb-4">15. Technical Security Measures</h2>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 dark:text-white mt-8 mb-4">16. Platform-Specific Privacy Considerations</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">Different social media platforms have varying privacy implications:</p>
            <ul class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
                <li><strong>YouTube</strong>: We access only public video data, not user accounts or private information</li>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 dark:text-white mt-8 mb-4">17. Analytics and Performance Monitoring</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">We may collect anonymous, aggregated statistics about service usage (such as number of downloads, popular platforms, error rates) to improve performance and reliability. This data cannot be linked to individual users and contains no personal information.</p>
            
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 dark:text-white mt-8 mb-4">18. Legal Compliance and Law Enforcement</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">We may disclose information if required by law, court order, or government request. However, given our minimal data collection and automatic deletion policies, there is typically no user data available to disclose.</p>
            
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 dark:text-white mt-8 mb-4">19. Service Providers and Processors</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">We may use third-party service providers for hosting, content delivery, or technical support. These providers are contractually bound to protect any data they may temporarily access and cannot use it for their own purposes.</p>
            
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 dark:text-white mt-8 mb-4">20. Privacy by Design</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">Our service is built with privacy as a fundamental principle. We collect only what's necessary, process it minimally, and delete it immediately. This "privacy by design" approach ensures your data protection is built into every aspect of our service.</p>
            
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 dark:text-white mt-8 mb-4">21. Retention Periods</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">Our data retention schedule is as follows:</p>
            <ul class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
                <li><strong>Downloaded Media Files</strong>: Deleted within 30 seconds of download completion</li>
                <li><strong>Processing Logs</strong>: Retained for 7 days for debugging purposes, then automatically deleted</li>
                <li><strong>Error Logs</strong>: Retained for 30 days for service improvement, contain no personal data</li>
                <li><strong>Session Data</strong>: Cleared when browser session ends</li>
                <li><strong>Temporary URLs</strong>: Processed and discarded immediately after use</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 dark:text-white mt-8 mb-4">22. Cross-Border Data Processing</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">When you download content from international platforms, temporary processing may occur in different countries. We ensure appropriate safeguards are in place for any cross-border data transfers, though our automatic deletion policy minimizes exposure.</p>
            
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 dark:text-white mt-8 mb-4">23. Automated Decision Making</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">Our service uses automated systems to process download requests, detect content types, and manage file cleanup. No automated decisions are made that significantly affect users, and all processing is transparent and predictable.</p>
            
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 dark:text-white mt-8 mb-4">24. Privacy Impact Assessments</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">We regularly conduct privacy impact assessments to identify and mitigate potential privacy risks. Our minimal data collection model significantly reduces privacy risks compared to traditional download services.</p>
            
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 dark:text-white mt-8 mb-4">25. User Control and Transparency</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">You have complete control over your use of our service. You can see exactly what's being processed (the URL you provide), when it's processed (immediately upon request), and when it's deleted (within 30 seconds). This transparency ensures you're always informed about data handling.</p>
            
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 dark:text-white mt-8 mb-4">26. Future Privacy Enhancements</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">We continuously work to enhance privacy protections. Future improvements may include even shorter retention periods, additional encryption measures, and enhanced user control features. Any changes will be communicated through policy updates.</p>
            
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 dark:text-white mt-8 mb-4">27. Contact Information and Data Protection Officer</h2>
